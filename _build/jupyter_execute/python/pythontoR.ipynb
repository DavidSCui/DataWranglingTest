    "Overall, the structural feel of Python and R is quite similar, with most differences being in syntax. The primary distinction lies in their design goals: R is specifically tailored for statistical analysis and data manipulation, while Python is a more general-purpose language, making it versatile across a wide range of applications beyond just data analysis.\n",

    "``` {topic} So why learn Python if I'm doing RA/Intern-level data work?\n",

    "Lots of the tasks involved in research are related to data wrangling, processing and cleaning. There is nothing that Python can't do that R can in this respect - R has **dplyr**, Python has **Pandas**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also generally considered to have a slight advantage in dealing with very large datasets and automation (i.e., functions). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Python is the closest thing to a universal \"high-level\" coding language. If programming is like diplomacy and international law in the UN, Python is like English because it is the most spoken and generally the most used, R is like French because it has more nuances suitable for the minute details needed for diplomacy and international law, while \"lower-level\" languages (like C or even Assembly) are the equivalent of UN diplomats communicating through pure unadulterated emotions and thoughts.\n",
