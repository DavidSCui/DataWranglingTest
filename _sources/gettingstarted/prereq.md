# 1a. Prerequisites

## Basic Requirements

The basic tools of data analysis are programming languages and the interfaces (IDEs: Integrated Development Environments) that make it easier to write them in. 

1. __[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)__
2. __[R & RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)__
3. __[Visual Studio Code 2](https://code.visualstudio.com/)__

> Among the most popular and accessible languages are **Python** and **R**. The IDEs associated with these are _PyCharm_ and _RStudio_ respectively, but in this documentation, we will primarily use _Visual Studio Code 2_ (VSCode) to work with Python, as it is a generalist interface that can be used to code in every widely-used programming language. It also comes with many tools that make it easy to navigate coding, data and directories as well as more advanced concepts like accessing the University of Melbourne's high performance computing system.

> This documentation also additionally utilises **Microsoft Excel** to visualise data.
