    "**Shells** are tools used to communicate and interact with your computer through text. You may be familiar with **Command Prompt** in Windows or the **Terminal** in Mac, which are examples of shells - it is like a basic interface for communicating and giving instructions to your computer.\n",

    "* **Bash** is the default shell for Mac and Linux.\n",
