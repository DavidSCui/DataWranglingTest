# 1b. Visual Studio Code

> Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a popular interface for programming. 

We're going to use VSCode because that's what everyone uses.

Once you have installed VSCode, open it up and we have a few things we'll need to do immediately.

1. First, we'll want to install the Python extension for VSCode, which can be done via the **extensions** tab on the left. Search up "Python" once prompted in the top-left window, and download the Python extension.

2. We'll then want to choose a directory (i.e. a folder) to do your coding in. Feel free to pick anything - this can be done by going back to the **Explorer** tab (top-most-left), then either following the prompt in the left window, or the prompt in the middle of the screen.

    **Create a new file** by pressing the new file icon next to the folder's name or right click on the empty left panel, then name your file and **end the filename with .py** to tell the computer that you are making a Python file.

3. You'll want to open up your terminal by clicking the button on the top-right of your screen that looks like an eraser pointing downwards.

4. **(Recommended)** This is optional but is generally considered good practice - we'll want to set up a "virtual environment" to conduct your code in. In short, this will make it so that all the code you use is self-contained in the specific project you are engaged in, and is useful in keeping your computer organised and sharing your projects with others.
    1. To do this, you will need to click the big search bar on the top of the screen
    2. select **"Show and Run Commands"**
    3. type in *"Python: Create Environment"*, 
    4. then click the option that shows up. 
    5. click "Venv" 
    6. select the latest version of Python available to you
